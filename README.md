# ToDo List App with React and Formik


This is a simple ToDo List application built using React and Formik. It allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks from their to-do list.

## Features

- Add tasks: You can easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- Remove tasks: You can remove tasks when they are no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Formik: A form library for React that simplifies form handling.

## Usage

- To add a new task, type the task name in the input field and press the "Add" button.
- To edit a task, click on the task you want to edit, make your changes, and click the "Save" button.
- To remove a task, click on the task you want to delete, and then click the "Delete" button.

## How It Works

The app is built using React to manage the UI components, and Formik is used for form handling. The task list is stored in the app's state.

- `App.js`: The main component that manages the list of tasks.
- `TaskList.js`: A component that displays the list of tasks and handles adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
- `TaskItem.js`: A component that represents a single task item.
- `TaskForm.js`: A Formik form for adding and editing tasks.
